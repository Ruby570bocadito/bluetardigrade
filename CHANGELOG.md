# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):
while the project is pre-1.0, minor versions may carry breaking changes to the
event schema or the HTTP API (the schema contract itself is documented in the
OpenAPI spec and guarded in CI). The version reported by `engine version` is
injected at link time from the release tag — see `.github/workflows/release.yml`
and the `make dist` target.

## [Unreleased]

In-flight work is tracked in the agents' round reports (`docs/agentes/`) and
lands here as it ships.

### Added

**Sensors and telemetry**

- The Rust ETW sensor can encrypt the engine connection: `--tls-ca <ca.pem>`
  (or `SF_INGEST_CA`) upgrades every (re)connection to TLS with the engine's
  certificate verified against the given CA bundle — pinned CA only, no
  skip-verification mode. TLS sits below the AUTH handshake, so the wire
  protocol is unchanged; the handshake phase is bounded by the same 10 s
  deadline as AUTH. Completes transit encryption end to end with the engine's
  `-ingest-cert`/`-ingest-key` listener.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-09-30

First tagged release of the framework as it exists in the tree today. Every
capability listed below is implemented and verified (CI: Go fmt/build/vet/test
with `-race`, console tests + typecheck + build, sensor `cargo check --locked`
on two targets, OpenAPI drift guard, and a behavioral Windows smoke of the
active-response handle path with real process kills).

### Added

**Sensors and telemetry**

- Windows-first ETW sensor in Rust (Sysmon-class telemetry: process create /
  terminate, process access, file write, network connect, image load, registry
  set) plus `sf-devsensor`, a deterministic simulated-TTP scenario generator so
  the full pipeline can be exercised on any platform without ETW.

**Detection engine (Go)**

- NDJSON-over-TCP ingest with 1 MiB per-line cap, identity-field truncation
  (host/user/id/network destination), field-separator stripping at the
  boundary, and shared-token authentication with constant-time comparison and
  a zero-downtime rotation window (`-token-previous`).
- Enrichment pipeline (user domain split, image origin system/userland,
  engine uptime) that never mutates raw evidence fields.
- YAML detection rules with hot reload, Sigma rule import (`engine sigma`,
  strict mode optional), and kill-chain sequence correlation with a tracked
  state cap.
- Risk scoring per host with decay, beaconing detector over `network.connect`
  (A3) with per-key state caps, and volumetric thresholds (A2: brute force,
  mass deletion, sprays) with per-key quotas.
- Alert lifecycle (acknowledged/closed + notes) persisted across restarts,
  and operator suppressions (rule/host pairs with expiry) hot-reloaded from
  YAML.
- Active response `kill_process` under layered authorization (R1-R8): bearer
  token mandatory even on loopback, operators allowlist, protected process
  defaults, host-pinning, PID/name match, per-PID cooldown, idempotency keys,
  synchronous result, and an append-only JSONL forensic audit (one line per
  attempt, denials included, fsync per line, 64 MiB rotation ceiling,
  `resolved_name` recorded).
- SQLite persistence (opt-in) for events and alerts beyond the in-memory
  rings, with retention sweeps.

**Interfaces**

- Local HTTP API (read-only by default) with bearer-token auth, RFC 7235
  challenges, SSE streams, bulk exports, Prometheus `/metrics`, and an
  OpenAPI specification with a CI drift guard (spec <-> code).
- SIEM delivery: Elasticsearch bulk indexing (daily indices, deterministic
  per-alert `_id` so retries never duplicate) and Splunk HEC, both with
  optional API-key/token headers; plus generic webhook (optional Bearer
  token) and external notifications (Slack, Telegram, email).
- Web console (Next.js) with real-time triage, rule/sequence/suppression
  management views, read-only active-response view, and the analyst AI view;
  fed by `sf-console-service`, the realtime telemetry hub.
- Dockerfile and installer scripts (PowerShell) for engine/sensor
  deployment, including firewall opt-in.

**Engineering**

- Continuous integration covering all three build surfaces (engine, console,
  sensor), the OpenAPI guard, a `-race` engine run, and a behavioral
  Windows smoke that executes real kills against its own disposable
  processes with a bounded single retry.
- Local verification battery: `make ci`, per-surface smokes
  (`scripts/dev-tests/`), and the agent verification guide
  (`docs/agentes/GUIA-VERIFICACION.md`).
